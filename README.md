This project is a straightforward web-based counter demonstrating basic JavaScript logic for state management and user interaction. It allows users to increase, decrease, and reset a numerical value.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

HTML5: Provides the structure for the counter display and the control buttons.

CSS3: For styling, ensuring a clean and centered layout, and adding visual feedback (e.g., color changes for positive/negative values).

Vanilla JavaScript: The core functionality is implemented using pure JavaScript for:

Tracking the current count value (state management).

Event Handling on button clicks.

Dynamically updating the value displayed on the screen (DOM manipulation).

‚ú® Key Features

Increase/Decrease: Buttons to increment or decrement the counter value.

Reset: A dedicated button to instantly return the count to zero.

Visual Feedback: The displayed number changes color (e.g., green for positive, red for negative) to provide immediate visual context of the current state.
